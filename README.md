# leetcode-problems

* Every class will contain a problem (just like leet code, it has a class for every solution);
* In the main class I left two classes that will have commented out the print method
  - One class is the Solved and the other is the Pending, for problems, respectively
  - If you want to see how I set it up on the Main class just call the print method on the Solved class in Main().
* Each Class will have multiple solutions

## Note: In the solved class you will often see single quotes
* This is for the comments to work, while on implementation you need to use double quotes.
* Testing
